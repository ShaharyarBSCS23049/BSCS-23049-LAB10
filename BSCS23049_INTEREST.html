    <h1>My goals and interests</h1>
    <P>I am interested in bulding my own power house, once i finsih my bachelors from ITU. Howveer, currently my passion
        lies with programming in c++ and python. I have also taken a course of python from youtube and cs50's website.
        Lately at ITU i have explored lots of platforms which pique my interest such as visual studio, scratch, ubunto
        etc. Apart from studying codes, i often play console games, football and cricket. Gaming on console usually
        involves me playing Call of duty, fifa, taken, resident evil etc. </P>
