        <h1>Educational Background</h1>
        <P> As stated previously, i started my educational journey at the age of 3. I did my <b>O-levels</b> from <b>Brick School</b>. My o-levels involed me studying the regular 5 subjects compulsory for pakistan and the optional ICT, Physics and Chemistry. I did my <B>A-levels</B> from Lahore Alma. It was quite a drastic rise in difficulty.
             The subjects i studied were <b><i>Computer Science, Mathematics and physics.</i></it></b> Bricks was a better experience then Alma academically, my life there was also more fun. 
             My educational experience under the <B>cambridge</B> system was exceptional, this system offered less rote learning and more conceptual studies then our traditional system. </P>
